Q: k
A: To create a rounded box around your lists, use the following CSS properties on your ul and ol selectors:
ul, ol{ 
  border: 3px solid #a88109;       
  border-radius: 10px;             
  padding: 15px;                   
  width: fit-content;              
}

Q: I want the unordered lists to be centered, but I evidently have no idea what I'm doing. I didn't see a center option for "float" and the "padding" option wasn't giving me what I want,either. Please advise.
A: To center your unordered lists (ul), use margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; and set a width. Example:
ul { 
  border: 3px solid #a88109;       
  border-radius: 10px;          
  padding: 15px;                
  width: 60%;                   
  margin-left: auto;            
  margin-right: auto;           
  display: block;               
}

Q: Give me some advice for creating text shadow.
A: To create a text shadow in CSS, use the text-shadow property. Example:
selector {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;
}

Q: Am I suppose to type DOCTYPE on the top of a CSS stylesheet
A: No, you should not type <!DOCTYPE> at the top of a CSS stylesheet.
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is only for HTML files. CSS files should start directly with your CSS code.

Q: Can I have a log of our chat to email to my teacher to show what I consulted you for?
A: Certainly! Hereâ€™s a log of your chat with GitHub Copilot that you can email to your teacher.

Q: Actually, I think I need the chat log as a URL or some kind of file that I can paste into a submission line. I cannot submit images.
A: You can copy and paste the chat log above into a text file or submit it as plain text.
