    <h1>Evaluating a Website</h1>
  ided to analyze this <a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/#government" target="_blank">website of Hawaii</a> for this assignment.
<p>After going through several websites and running them through the accessibility checker, I found this website gave me the best results overall. Now that I have selected my website to evaluate, I will answer the questions that my teacher asked me.</p>

    <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<p> I ordered the list for this one and put each answer underneath its corresponding question.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the URL of the website?</li>
<li> https://portal.ehawaii.gov/#government</li>
<li>What is the name of the website? </li>
<li>Hawaii.gov</li> 
<li>Who is the site's target audience?</li>
<li>Anyone who wants to learn anything about Hawaii. Tourists, future residents, etc.</li>
<li>How is the site organized? </li>
<li> The website has been organized in a linear fashion.</li>
<li>Which CRAP Design Principle does the use? Provide at least one example.</li>
<li>C.R.A.P. stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. <br> 
Information that is relavant to each other is grouped together. For <br> example,
stuff like "Voting and Elections" and "State Officials" are <br> found under the Government section of the webpage. <br> 
 Topics like <br> "Tax Services" and "Nonprofits" are found underneath the <br> business tab. There is also a "Residents" and "Visitors" section. <br>
The elements of the webpage are organized in a manner that doesn't look cluttered or disorganized. The color scheme used for the <br> website creates a sense of contrast that
helps elements stand out from each other.  </li>
<li>What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?</li>
<li> 95%</li>
<li>What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</li>
<li>The layout and user-friendliness of this website is astounding to me. <br> 
I mostly browse commercial websites or websites related to video games, so I was pleased to see a government-based website with <br> such a pristine, easy-to-view layout.</li>
<li>What is the site's efficiency? Can users can perform tasks quickly?</li>
<li>It does not take long for a page to load after clicking a button on this website. I clicked on the "Website" button under "Visitors"
    <br> section; it took less than a second to load this webpage with info <br> regarding the weather over the week for Hawaii.
</li>
<li>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</li>
<li>Without quesiton. You should try it for yourself if my word does not <br> satisfy you. I left a hyperlink in the header section.</li>
<li>Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</li>
<li>I might be nitpicking, but I have three recommendations. First, <br>
I feel that the text in the footer tab could be enlarged by a couple of <br>
pixels. The text is so difficult to read. Second, I wish that the flag for <br> Hawaii
was placed on the home page somewhere. Third, I notced that <br> there is an arrow prompt that pops up whenever
I scroll down the page. <br> This button takes me back up to the top of the webpage. Why isn't <br> there a button that can
guide me to the bottom of the page? </li>
