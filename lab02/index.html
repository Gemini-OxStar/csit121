<h1> Two Weeks Later</h1>
<p>
After two weeks, it feels good to be taking this class again. This time, I aim to ace it. Here are three key facts I learned 
after participating in this class for two weeks.
</p>

<ul>
<li> The difference between head, header, and heading tags.<br> The head tag is used to capture all of the 
information needed to make the webpage run. Such info includes stylesheet links, and other general
document information. <br> 
The header tag is a custom tag you place in the body of the html. You ideally want to use this tag to store 
navigational aids, headings, logos, etc. <br>
Headings are keyword-infused titles that help the search engines understand the structure of your page content. </li>
<li> I have to type in the extension into the URL on GitHub to get to the html that I want.</li>
<li> The parts of a URL. The scheme (HTTP, HTTPS,) domain name (www.something.com,) the path to the file (/this/that/theother,) 
    parameters (?key1=value1&key2=value2,) and an anchor (#somewhereinthedocument.)
</li>
</ul>

<h2> A Fun Class</h2>

I'm not as nervous as I was when I first took this class. I feel I should be able to handle myself with reasonability.
