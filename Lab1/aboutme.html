            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a man who was born and raised in Maryland. I was diagnosed as with ADHD when I was youger, but 
                didn't find out about it until I was in middle school. Needless to say, making friends or social 
                situations in general have been an eternal struggle for me. Focusing on tasks is a challenge, too.
                I'm trying to get to a stable stride with my academics before I resume studying for a driver's permit
                or seeking employment.

             I'm studying information technology; computer science (Calculus in partucular)  
             was not working out well. I'm hoping the more corporeal nature of info technology
             will be much easier for me to grasp.
