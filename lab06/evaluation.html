            given to me to ask about the website. </article>

        <h2>Answers:</h2>
        <ol>
        
        <li><a href="https://dnr.maryland.gov/Publiclands/Pages/campinginfo.aspx">https://dnr.maryland.gov/Publiclands/Pages/campinginfo.aspx</a></li>
        
        <li>Maryland Department of Natural Resources - Camping Information</li>
        
        <li>The target audience for this website is people who are interested in camping in Maryland's
            public parks and natural areas. Such people include families, nature enthusiasts, and outdoor adventurers.</li>
       
        <li>I would describe the organization of this website as hierarchical. There's a navigation bar at the top of the page that links to 
            the important things like finding a state park that's renting out camping spaces or cabins, each park's activities and amenitites, and the home page 
        of this website. There is a section menu that provides links to pages with info like park fees and hours of operation, park passes, and more on the side 
    (it collapes into a selection menu when the screen is shrunk down.)  </li>
        
        <li>I feel that this webpage utilized contrast better than repetition, alignment, and proximity. The use of a natural image for the navigation bar makes it stand out immensely.
            The use of the color red for hyperlinks within the paragraphs of the HTML stand out compared to the rest of the info, too. </li>
       
        <li>The audit score form the accessibility checker was a meager 47%. The 10 primary issues have to do with failing elements, evidently.
            Failing class selectors, to be precise. </li>
        
         <li>The effectiveness is a bit more difficult for me to judge. I personally thinnk the semantics were structured well, but that's only my opinion. Everyone
            has differing opinions on what makes for effective design. From my perspective, I think the website is effective in supporting users in completing actions accurately.<br>
            The navigation bar at the top of the page is easy to use and understand, and the side menu offers quick access to important info.
         </li>
        
         <li>I don't know if it's just the fact that I have a good laptop, but the webpage seems to be really good at loading up info without any slowdown.
            I was able to navigate through the different sections of the webpage quickly and without any lag. It probably helps that images used are optimized to not take up
            too much of the webpage. 
         </li>
        
         <li>This website has a list on the left-hand side to show all sorts of information and events at the park. Such events include food truck
            vending opportunities, hiking events, statewide park policies, and more. All the information you may need is readily available on the left-hand side of the webpage.
            I should note that it collapses into a selection menu if the screen size is reduced, which is a nice touch for mobile users.<br>
            Another thing that makes this webpage engaging is the use of images to show you what the parks and their accommodations look like. There are images of cabins, parts of the parks,
            and families engaging in activities like crafts, fishing, canoeiung, and more. This gives the user a better idea of what to expect when they visit the parks.</li>
       
        <li>I personally think that things on the main page like the contact information at the top of the page should have been colored red like the rest of the hyperlinks on the page to make them stand out more for those
            looking for contact info. Another recommendation I have is fixing those selector issues that the accessibility checker pointed out to me.
