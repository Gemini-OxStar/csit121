            <h3>About This Image</h3>
            <p>A dessert that utilizes a few simple ingredients, but can be easily messed up if you aren't careful. A custard that can be flavored
                in whatever way you desire (vanilla, orange, etc.) and topped with sugar that is caramelized with a kitchen torch. Breaking your spoon
                through that caramelized sugar top is satisfying.
            </p>

            <h3>Why GIF Format?</h3>
            <p>I wanted to use a GIF format to showcase the creme brulee being actively caramelized. Seeing that is oddly satisfying. But the one gif I 
                could find that showed creme brulee sugar being caramelized didn't look appetizing. 
                Therefore, I decided on a GIF that showcases the creme brulee being busted open with a spoon. GIFs are the first thing people think
                of when you think of an animated short image. They are able to support animations, but are limited to a palette of 256 colors.
