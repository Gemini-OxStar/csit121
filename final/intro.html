            <h2> How We Do Business</h2>
            <p> 
                We have 6 blends to choose from depending on the current season. our baked goods also change with the seasons.
                With this, customers will want to visit more often to try each blend that we provide each
                season, and you'll seldom get the same thing over and over again. Flexibility is key in life, as we say.
