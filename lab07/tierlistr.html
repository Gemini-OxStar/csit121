        <h1>Tierlist of Dream Roster for MVC4</h1>
<p><i>Published by Timothy Kluver on November 8, 2025.</i></p>
    </header>

    <p>I decided to create a tier list for characters I would want to see in a Marvel vs Capcom 4 (nobody counts MCVI.)
        S and A tiers are gonna be characters I really want to see, B and C are ones I can take or leave, and D-tier are 
        characters I really don't want to see. <br>I'm also strictly focusing on Marvel and Capcom characters that haven't 
        appeared in any previous MVC games. These games include X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter, 
        and Marvel vs Capcom 1-3. In case you were wondering about Tatsunoko vs Capcom, I'm unsure if that one counts for this series given that Marvel
        has nothing to do with it and its limited release(s).

<h2>Explanation of Choices</h2>
<p> It was trutfully difficult for me to come up with a tierlist for this. I had to put a lot of thought (maybe more thought than necessary)
    on what order I wanted these in. I also had to re-examine the rosters of previous MVC games to make sure I didn't accidentally include characters
    that have already made an appearance in the prior games. The other pain was making sure I found images that were Creative Commons
    or free to share and use. Didn't want to step on any legal toes. If you have any questions or input to offer, please go to the contact form. The link is in the navigation bar.</p>
