        <h2>BitstringStatusListEntry</h2>
        <p>
            Issuers can add a <i>credentialStatus</i> property to enable status info for a 
            Verifiable Credential (VC). Such properties include id, type, statusPurpose, statusList Index, statusSize, and many more.
            Status list entries can be used to express the purpose of a status associated with a verifiable credential by using the <i>statusPurpose</i>
            property. Using <i>revocation</i> or <i>suspension</i> as the status purpose expresses whether a VC has been revoked
            or suspended, respectively. Using <i>message</i> as the status purpose enables an issuer to 
            define a number of custom, descriptive messages about the status of the verifiable credential.

        <h2>How Bitstring Status List Credential Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Any credential intended to be revocable includes in its credentialStatus field a reference to
            the URL of theh status list (accessed with <i>statusListCredential</i>) and the index it occupies in the bitstring (found with <i>statusListIndex</i>).
            To check the status of a credential, one would retrieve the status list credential from the URL specified in the <i>statusListCredential</i> field.
            Next, you would download the <i>statusListCredential</i> resource (Ex: /credentials/status/1).
            Then, decode the bitstring found in the <i>encodedList</i> field of the status list credential. This <i>encodesList</i> holds a 16KB binary string that is compressed with GZIP and 
            encoded in Base64URL. Bits that are 0 are marked as valid; those marked with 1 are to be revoked or suspended. FInaly, you can read the bit status at <i>statusListIndex</i>.

    <h2> Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
        There are three different ue cases for Bitstring Status List. First, M2M Revocation. Automatic agents or machines
        with delegated credentials can be easily revoked when the mandate ends.
        Second, temprary acces. BSL is useful in platforms with time-limited passes or event-based credentials. Finally, legal compliance.
        Traceability can be enables in accordsnce with frameworks like AML or eIDAS 2.0 without compromising privacy.
