    <h1>Bitstring Status List v1.0</h1>

        <p> Good day, everyone! In this HTML, I'm going to teach the viewers about 
            the web standard known as Bitstring Status List (BSL). We will be focusing on version 1.0
            in particular. But before we get into that, we need to understand what Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are.

    <h2>What are Verifiable Credentials (VCs)?</h2>
    <p>
        <u>Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</u> are called "one of the core pillars of the 
        decentralized digital identity ecosystem" (Canades, 2025.) for a reason. As part of the W3C standard, VCs are digital credentials that allow individuals to prove certain attributes
        or qualifications in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. Unlike more traditional certfificates, Verifiable Credentials don't require
        a <u>Certification Authority</u> or <u>PKI (public key infrastructure)</u> for validation. This introduces a unique challenge:
        how can we verify a credential's validity at the time of use and revoke it without exposing the holder's identity?
        That's where Bitstring Status List (BSL) comes in.

        <p>
            <u>Bitstring Status List (BSL)</u> is a privacy-preserving mechanism for publishing status info
            about Verifiable Credentials (VCs). It enables issuers (the role an entity performs by creating verifiable credentials from certified claims,
            then transmitting them to a holder) to manage credential statuses like suspension or revocation through 
            compressed bitstrings while attaining anonymity and scalability. It doesn't identify a subject, just lists the status of credentials (claims made by an issuer on different subjects). 
            Some key features include minimal bandwidth usage, compatibility with the <u>Content Distribution Network (CDN)</u>, privacy-preserving group status updates,
            a highly compressible format, no false positives, and the ability to support multiple status types per credential.
