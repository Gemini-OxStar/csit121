    <h1>Why Is BSL Important?</h1>
    <p> <i>Published by Timothy Kluver on November 30, 2025.</i></p>

            <p> So what is it that makes Bitstring Status List so important? BSL provides a way to track 
        credential status changes while preserving privacy. Such status types include revocation, suspension, and refresh.
        In traditional systems, checking the status of a credential often involves querying a centralized database. This has the risk
        of exposing the holder's identity and driving up bandwidth cost. Like I said on the previous page, BSL addresses these issues by using compressed bitstrings to represent the status of multiple credentials.
        Thus, one can check credential statuses without revealing which particular credentials are being checked.
            </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In addition to being private, BSL is also scalable. This is becuase it uses a compact bitstring format.
        One signed credential represents the status of 130k credentials. Also, the format is highly compressible, capable of supporting higher
        than 90% compression ratios in most cases.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Another thing about BSL is that it has faster querying. Statuses are endoded as bitstrings with BSL. This allows one to
        perform a direct index-styled lookup rather than having to scan large datasets. A simple HTTP GET and bitwise operation is all you need with Bitstring Status List.
