<h1>After Two Weeks</h1></h1>

<p>
After two weeks, I must say that this class continues to find <br> 
new ways to intrigue me. While I'm nervous, I find the idea of building webpages
like this to be quite engaging. Here <br> are three things that I've learned in class thus far:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Tags for html commands like unordered lists, paragraphs, breaks in statements, etc.</li>
<li> I have to type in the extension into the URL on GitHub to get to the html that I want.</li>
<li> How Internet connections ran through dial-up before broadband connections became the mainstay. </li>
</ul>

<h2> I'm Enjoying Myself</h2>

I was a bit nervous at first since we didn't have a traditional <br>
reading source. But I feel confident that I'll be able to manage myself <br>
with reasonability. These links proved very informative:

<h3> Informative links</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content"> Creating HTML Hyperlinks</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://youtu.be/1CsPHKJWiw0"> Differences between Web and Internet</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Dealing_with_files">Manipulating files </a> </li>
</ol>

<h4> More Learning Experiences</h4>
<p>
If there are three pieces of advice I can give for any 
future web-designers, this is what they would be:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> Never wait until the last minute to try and get this kind of work done.</li>
<li> Do not be afraid to experiment with the different features HTML has to offer.</li>
<li> For a big assignment, try to get it done piece-by-piece over the week.</li>
</ul>
