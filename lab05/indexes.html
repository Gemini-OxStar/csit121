            <h2>Labs 1 &amp; 2 </h2>
            <p><i>Published on September 28, 2025 by Timothy Kluver</i></p>
            <p>
                Working on these assignments was daunting at first, but I started to get the gist of it
                as I continued working on the first two labs. It helps that I have experience from taking this class
                in the previous semester.

            <h3>Three Key Factors I Have Learned:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The difference between head, header, and heading tags.<br> The head tag is used to capture all of the 
information needed to make the webpage run. Such info includes stylesheet links, and other general
document information. <br> 
The header tag is a custom tag you place in the body of the html. You ideally want to use this tag to store 
navigational aids, headings, logos, etc. <br>
Headings are keyword-infused titles that help the search engines understand the structure of your page content. </li>
<li> The parts of a URL. The scheme (HTTP, HTTPS,) domain name (www.something.com,) the path to the file (/this/that/theother,) 
    parameters (?key1=value1&key2=value2,) and an anchor (#somewhereinthedocument.)</li>
                <li>To make a sentence in a paragraph tag italicized, you must insert 'i' tags around the words
                    you want this effect on. <i>This is what a sentence wrapped in 'i' tags looks like.</i>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Labs 3 </h2>
               When it comes to learning CSS, I can't decide what is harder: remembering every single code line so I know what
               manipulates what, remembering how to input images properly, developing animations, or coming up with a color scheme
               that isn't hard on the eyes. 
              </p>
              <p>Having access to resources on the website made this somewhat less tedious. Here are some things I learned:                
              </p> 
                <h3>What I Learned From Studying Module 3:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sketching out the layout of your HTML before implementing it can be beneficial to see if there are any potential
                        problems with your design choices. Wireframes also help accomplish this.
                    </li>
                    <li>The notes on Brightspace help me understand how to format CSS tags and what each tag does.</li>
                    <li>This color picker resource I found helps me pick colors that compliment the overall theme I'm going with for the 
                        webpage design.
                    </li>

            <h2>Best Design Practices </h2>
            <p>
               I'm still struggling to get a grip on understanding the way these flexbox and grids work. I am hoping that 
               with more practice and maybe some tutoring, I can finally get a better grasp on design practices.
               I can already see the potential of this in terms of making a more comprehensive, tidy layout. It's just all the coding
               and detail that I find to be an overwhelming hassle.
