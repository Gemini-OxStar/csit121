            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 28-year old man who was born and raised here in Maryland. I'm kind of an introvert, so 
                communicating with others and getting my points across challenging for me. My ADHD only adds to this struggle.
                I don't want to be inhibited by these traits my whole life, otherwise I'll never accomplish anything. I'm hoping
                the skills I learn here can help me attain a high-paying job. It'll be even better if it goes beyond the standard,
                dreary, thankless 9-5.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                
             My major is in information technology: something very useful in today's digital age. I'm hoping to get somewhere 
             with this (assuming the nation isn't reduced to dust and waste matter thanks to Trump and his brainless, soulless,
             egocentric clique, as well as corporate avarice.) I want to ask my teacher on some insights she may have on careers that revolve around information tech. 
             Focus 2 only tells me so much. I wanna hear what a living, breathing person has to say on the matter. 
             It'd be nice if I could get a nice job with only 2 years in college. At this point in my life, I do not see
             the utility in attending a 4-year college. I do not feel like paying more money for schooling. My mom says I should know if further
             education is gonna serve me in my career and figure out how it is getting paid for. Considering her personal experience, I find value
             in that advice.
