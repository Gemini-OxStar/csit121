<h1> After Two Weeks</h1>
<p>
After two weeks, I must say that this class continues to find <br> 
new ways to intrigue me. While I'm nervous, I find the idea of building webpages
like this to be quite engaging. Here <br> are three things that I've learned in class thus far:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Tags for html commands like unordered lists, paragraphs, breaks in statements, etc.</li>
<li> I have to type in the extension into the URL on GitHub to get to the html that I want.</li>
<li> How Internet connections ran through dial-up before broadband connections became the mainstay. </li>
</ul>

<h2> I'm Enjoying Myself</h2>

I was a bit nervous at first since we didn't have a traditional <br>
reading source. But I feel confident that I'll be able to manage myself <br>
with reasonability. These links proved very informative:
